Perfect — let’s go step by step, in a developer-friendly way, without diving into heavy crypto math.

## JWE (JSON Web Encryption)

JWE is a standard for **encrypting data** (usually tokens) in a structured way so different libraries can read/write them consistently.

A JWE is just a **string with 5 parts**, separated by `.` dots:

```
<protected header>.<encrypted key>.<initialization vector>.<ciphertext>.<auth tag>
```

Each part is **Base64URL-encoded JSON or binary**.

Example (simplified):

```
eyJhbGciOiAiZGlyIiwgImVuYyI6ICJBMjU2R0NNIn0..mF9ivkY...cryptedData...authTag
```

* **Header**: JSON saying *how* it’s encrypted, e.g.

  ```json
  { "alg": "dir", "enc": "A256GCM" }
  ```

  * `"alg": "dir"` → means *“directly use a shared key, don’t encrypt it with RSA/ECDH/etc.”*
  * `"enc": "A256GCM"` → AES, 256-bit key, in GCM mode.

* **Encrypted key**: empty here (because `"alg": "dir"` means we already share the key).

* **IV**: random bits needed for GCM encryption (nonce).

* **Ciphertext**: the actual encrypted payload.

* **Auth tag**: integrity check — makes sure ciphertext wasn’t tampered with.

So a JWE is basically:

> JSON header + some binary blobs (key/IV/ciphertext/tag), all base64url-encoded, glued with dots.

## HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function)

Now, how do we **get the encryption key**? That’s where HKDF comes in.

HKDF takes:

* An **input secret** (like `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`).
* Optionally some **salt** (extra randomizer).
* Optionally an **info** string (context label, e.g. `"NextAuth.js Generated Encryption Key"`).

And produces:

* A fixed-length strong key (e.g. 256 bits for AES).

It works in 2 phases:

1. **Extract**: Normalize the secret into a strong “pseudorandom key” using HMAC.
2. **Expand**: Stretch/shape it into as many bytes as needed, mixing in `info`.

You can think of it like a factory function:

```js
function hkdf(secret, salt, info, length) {
  // 1. extract
  prk = HMAC(salt, secret)
  // 2. expand
  okm = HMAC(prk, info + counter)
  return okm.slice(0, length)
}
```

## Putting it Together in NextAuth

* NextAuth takes your `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.
* Runs **HKDF** on it to get a 256-bit AES key.
* Uses that key in **AES-256-GCM**.
* Builds a **JWE** with `"alg": "dir"` and `"enc": "A256GCM"`.
* Stores the result in a cookie.

When a request comes in, it reverses the process:

* Parse the JWE parts.
* Use the derived key to decrypt.
* Verify the auth tag.
* If anything is off → cookie is cleared.
